This is PAL, our second year project.
It is a personal security mobile application which aims to keep people
safe as they walk home at night. It uses the latest crime data to calculate the safest route possible, whilst using search algorithms to ensure it is short and safe.
It also boasts a number of other security features such as: listening to the device accelerometer to detect a potential attack, watching for any deviations from the generated path which may indicate something is wrong, a deadman's switch to give the user control over their security.
If any of these security features are activated, then the app locks the user into a countdown screen which defaults at 15 seconds, when the countdown reaches 0 it will prompt the user to call a trusted contact which they have set. It will also record audio and video automatically to be used as potential evidence.
